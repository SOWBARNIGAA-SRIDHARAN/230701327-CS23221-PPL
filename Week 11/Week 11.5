Write a Python program that asks the user for their age and prints a message based on the age. Ensure that the program handles cases where the input is not a valid integer.

Input Format: A single line input representing the user's age.

Output Format: Print a message based on the age or an error if the input is invalid.
Program: 
age_input = input("Please enter your age: ").strip()

try:
	age = int(age_input)
	if age < 0:
		print("Error: Please enter a valid age.")
	else:
		print(f"You are {age} years old.")
except ValueError:
	print("Error: Please enter a valid age.")
          #print("arvijayakumar")
