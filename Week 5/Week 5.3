Complete the program to count frequency of each element of an array. Frequency of a particular element will be printed once.
 
Program:
n = int(input())
arr = []
for i in range(n):
    element = int(input())
    arr.append(element)
arr.sort()
processed = []
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] not in processed:
        count = arr.count(arr[i])
        print(f"{arr[i]} occurs {count} times")
        processed.append(arr[i])
