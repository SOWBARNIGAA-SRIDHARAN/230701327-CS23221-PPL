Write a program to print all the locations at which a particular element (taken as input) is found in a list and also print the total number of times it occurs in the list. The location starts from 1.


Program:
n = int(input())
print()
lst = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
target = int(input())
count = 0
location = 1  
for element in lst:
    if element == target:
        print(f"Element found at location: {location}")
        count += 1
    location += 1  
if count > 0:
    print(f"Total occurrences of the element: {count}")
else:
    print(f"{target} is not present in the array.")
