A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.
Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.
Program:
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
word1 = s1.split()
word2 = s2.split()
word_count1 = {}
word_count2 = {}
for word in word1:
    word_count1[word] = word_count1.get(word,0) + 1
for word in word2:
    word_count2[word] = word_count2.get(word,0) + 1
uncommon_word = set()
for word,count in word_count1.items():
    if count == 1 and word not in word_count2:
        uncommon_word.add(word)
for word,count in word_count2.items():
    if count == 1 and word not in word_count1:
        uncommon_word.add(word)
if len(uncommon_word) == 0:
    print('No uncommon words')
else:
    x=list(uncommon_word)
    print(*x)
