Create a student dictionary  for n students with the student name as key and their test mark assignment mark and lab mark as values. Do the following computations and display the result.
1.Identify the student with the  highest average score
2.Identify the student who as the highest Assignment marks
3.Identify the student with the Lowest lab marks
4.Identify the student with the lowest average score
Note:
If more than one student has the same score display all the student names


Program:
from operator import itemgetter
num = int(input())
students = []
for i in range(num):
    name, test, assgn, lab = input().split(" ")
    test, assgn, lab = int(test), int(assgn), int(lab)
    students.append({"name": name, "test": test, "assgn": assgn, "lab": lab, "avg" : (test + assgn + lab) / 3})
def get_names(items, field, comp):
    return sorted([i["name"] for i in items if i[field] == comp(items, key=itemgetter(field))[field]])
print(*get_names(students, "avg", max))
print(*get_names(students ,"assgn", max))
print(*get_names(students, "lab", min))
print(*get_names(students, "avg", min))
