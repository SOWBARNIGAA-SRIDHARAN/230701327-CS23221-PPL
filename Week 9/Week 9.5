In the game of Scrabble™, each letter has points associated with it. The total score of a word is the sum of the scores of its letters. More common letters are worth fewer points while less common letters are worth more points. 
Write a program that computes and displays the Scrabble™ score for a word. Create a dictionary that maps from letters to point values. Then use the dictionary to compute the score.
A Scrabble™ board includes some squares that multiply the value of a letter or the value of an entire word. We will ignore these squares in this exercise.


Program:
letter_values = {
    'A':1,'E':1,'I':1,'L':1,'N':1,'O':1,'R':1,'S':1,'T':1,'U':1,
    'D':2,'G':2,
    'B':3,'C':3,'M':3,'P':3,
    'F':4,'H':4,'V':4,'W':4,'Y':4,
    'K':5,
    'J':8,'K':8,
    'Q':10,'Z':10,
}
word = input()
score = sum(letter_values.get(letter.upper(),0) for letter in word)
print(f"{word} is worth {score} points.")
