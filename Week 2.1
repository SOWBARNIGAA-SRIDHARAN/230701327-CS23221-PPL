An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75 grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams.
Write a program that reads the number of widgets and the number of gizmos from the user. Then your program should compute and display the total weight of the parts.

Program:
print(f"The total weight of all these widgets and gizmos is {int(input()) * 75 + int(input()) * 112} grams.")
