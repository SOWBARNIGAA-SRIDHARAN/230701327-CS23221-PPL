Three numbers form a Pythagorean triple if the sum of squares of two numbers is equal to the square of the third.
For example, 3, 5 and 4 form a Pythagorean triple, since 3*3 + 4*4 = 25 = 5*5 
You are given three integers, a, b, and c. They need not be given in increasing order. If they form a Pythagorean triple, then print "Yes", otherwise, print "No". 

Program:
vars = sorted([int(input()), int(input()), int(input())])
if vars[2] ** 2 == vars[0] ** 2 + vars[1] ** 2 :
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
