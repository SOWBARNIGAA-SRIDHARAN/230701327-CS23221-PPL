The length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days. In this exercise you will create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string. Then your program should display the number of days in that month. Display “28 or 29 days” for February so that leap years are addressed.


Program:

thirtyOnes = ["January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December"]
month = input().strip()
if month == "February":
    print(f"{month} has 28 or 29 days in it.")
elif month in thirtyOnes:
    print(f"{month} has 31 days in it.")
else:
    print(f"{month} has 30 days in it.")
