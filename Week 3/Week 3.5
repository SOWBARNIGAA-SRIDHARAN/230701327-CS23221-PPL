In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters 'y' then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.

Program:
a = input()
if a in 'aeiou':
    print("It's a vowel.")
elif a == 'y':
    print("Sometimes it's a vowel... Sometimes it's a consonant.")
else:
    print("It's a consonant.")
