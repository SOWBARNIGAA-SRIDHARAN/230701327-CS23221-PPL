Two string values S1, S2 are passed as the input. The program must print first N characters present in S1 which are also present in S2.

Program:
S1 = input()
S2 = input()
N = int(input())
result = ''
for char in S1:
    if char in S2 and char not in result:
        result += char
        if len(result) == N:
            break
print(result)
