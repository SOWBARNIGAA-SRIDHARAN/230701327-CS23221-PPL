Write a program that takes as input a string (sentence), and returns its second word in uppercase.

For example:

If input is “Wipro Technologies Bangalore” the function should return “TECHNOLOGIES”
If input is “Hello World” the function should return “WORLD”
If input is “Hello” the program should return “LESS”

NOTE 1: If input is a sentence with less than 2 words, the program should return the word “LESS”.
NOTE 2: The result should have no leading or trailing spaces.


Program:
s = input()
words = s.split()
result = words[1].upper() if len(words) >= 2 else "LESS"
print(result)
