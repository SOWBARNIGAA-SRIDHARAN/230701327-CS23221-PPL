In many jurisdictions, a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. 
In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a $0.10 deposit and drink containers holding more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit.
Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size(less and more)  from the user. Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign and always displays exactly two decimal places.

Program:

print(f"Your total refund will be ${(0.1 * int(input())) + (.25 * int(input())):.2f}.")
