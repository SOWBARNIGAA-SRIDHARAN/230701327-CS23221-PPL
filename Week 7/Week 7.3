Write a code to check whether product of digits at even places is divisible by sum of digits at odd place of a positive integer.

Program:
def productDigits(n):
    num = str(n)
    even = 1
    odd = 0
    for i,digit in enumerate(num):
        digit = int(digit)
        if(i+1)%2 == 0: 
            even *= digit
        else:
            odd += digit
    return even % odd == 0
