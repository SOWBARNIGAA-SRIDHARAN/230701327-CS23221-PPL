Complete function to implement coin change making problem i.e. finding the minimum
number of coins of certain denominations that add up to given amount of money.
The only available coins are of values 1, 2, 3, 4


Program:
def coinChange(n):
    coin = [1,2,3,4]
    dp = [float('inf')]*(n+1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        for c in coin:
            if c <= i:
                dp[i]=min(dp[i],dp[i-c]+1)
    return dp[n]
