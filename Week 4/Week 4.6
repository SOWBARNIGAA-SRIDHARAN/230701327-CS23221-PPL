A Number is said to be Disarium number when the sum of its digit raised to the power of their respective positions becomes equal to the number itself. Write a program to print number is Disarium or not.

Program:
N = int(input())
temp = N
num_digits = 0
while temp > 0:
    num_digits += 1
    temp //= 10
sum_of_powers = 0
temp = N
while temp > 0:
    digit = temp % 10
    sum_of_powers += digit ** num_digits
    num_digits -= 1
    temp //= 10
if sum_of_powers == N:
    print("The number is a Disarium number.")
else:
    print("The number is not a Disarium number.")
