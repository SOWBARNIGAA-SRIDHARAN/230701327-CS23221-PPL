Write a program to find the sum of the series 1 +11 + 111 + 1111 + . . . + n terms (n will be given as input from the user and sum will be the output)

Program:

n = int(input())
term = 0
sum_of_series = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    term = term * 10 + 1
    sum_of_series += term
print(sum_of_series)
