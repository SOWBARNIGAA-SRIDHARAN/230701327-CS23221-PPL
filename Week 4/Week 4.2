Write a program to find the count of non-repeated digits in a given number N. The number will be passed to the program as an input of type int.
Assumption: The input number will be a positive integer number >= 1 and <= 25000.
Some examples are as below.
If the given number is 292, the program should return 1 because there is only 1 non--repeated digit '9' in this number
If the given number is 1015, the program should return 2 because there are 2 non-repeated digits in this number, '0', and '5'.
If the given number is 108, the program should return 3 because there are 3 non--repeated digits in this number, '1', '0', and '8'.
If the given number is 22, the function should return 0 because there are NO non--repeated digits in this number.


Program:

N = int(input())
non_repeated_count = 0

for digit in range(10):
    found = False  
    repeat = False  
    temp = N
    while temp > 0:
        current_digit = temp % 10
        if current_digit == digit:
            if found:
                repeat = True
                break
            found = True
        temp //= 10
     if found and not repeat:
        non_repeated_count += 1
print(non_repeated_count)
