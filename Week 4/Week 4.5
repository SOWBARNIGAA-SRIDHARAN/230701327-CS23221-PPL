Write a program to return the nth number in the fibonacci series. The value of N will be passed to the program as input.

Program:

N = int(input())
a, b = 0, 1
if N == 1:
    print(a)
elif N == 2:
    print(b)
else:
    for _ in range(2, N):
        a, b = b, a + b  
    print(b)  # b is the nth Fibonacci number
