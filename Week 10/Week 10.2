Given an listof integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:
1.      List is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
2.      First Element: firstElement, the  first element in the sorted list.
3.      Last Element: lastElement, the last element in the sorted list.
For example, given a worst-case but small array to sort: a=[6,4,1]. It took  3 swaps to sort the array. Output would be
Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
First Element: 1  
Last Element: 6   


Program:
n=int(input())
ele=input()
ele1=ele.split()
for i in range(len(ele1)):
    ele1[i]=int(ele1[i])
s_count=0
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(0,n-i-1):
        if ele1[j]>ele1[j+1]:
            s_count=s_count+1
            ele1[j],ele1[j+1]=ele1[j+1],ele1[j]
print('List is sorted in',s_count,'swaps.')
print('First Element:',ele1[0])
print('Last Element:',ele1[n-1])
