The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

Program:
s = input()
s_count = {}
for i in range (len(s)-9):
    substring = s[i:i+10]
    s_count[substring] = s_count.get(substring,0)+1
rep_string = [substring for substring,count in s_count.items() if count > 1]
for i in rep_string:
    print(i) â€ƒ
