There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.
Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

Program:
text = input()
text1 = text.lower()
bro_text = input()
words = text1.split()
validword = 0
for word in words:
    if any(letter in bro_text for letter in word):
        continue
    else:
        validword+=1
print(validword)
